# graph
Yet another simple graph library 

* Implements a template graph class that stores template Vertices and its edges can store data too.
* Uses STL (std::list and std::map)
* Uses adjacency list implementation (good with non-dense graphs)
* Add vertices and edges easily. Removal is not considered!
* Included a method that performs depth first search in the graph.
* toString method to easily debug and represent data
* Basic functionality test included
* Added symmetric graphs support (each call to addEdge adds two edges). Tested!
